# Fabrica-relay — Tasks

> Single source of truth for relay server work. Schema: `.Fabrica-board/Fabrica-Schema.md`. The Roadmap (`.Fabrica-Board/Fabrica-Roadmap.md`) tracks cross-cutting status only — this file owns execution details.

## High-Level Goals

> WHAT THIS PROJECT IS FOR — read this before any task:

1. **Phone↔desktop works everywhere.** A reliable E2EE WebSocket bridge so the mobile companion controls the desktop app even off-LAN.
2. **Wire-compatible, always.** Any change matches the client schemas in `Fabrica-app/src/main/runtime/relay/relay-control-protocol.ts` — the client is the spec.
3. **$0 and secure.** Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects free tier; challenge-response auth; no secrets in code.
4. **Beta-launch ready.** Live deployment verified end-to-end with a real pairing — gate for Roadmap Phase B (close REL-R16/R22 integration tests).

## Rollup

_Last recount: 2026-08-24 (orchestrator promoted REL-R16/R22 after verifying 44/44 tests + tsc clean). Recount re-confirmed 2026-08-24 after wrangler v3→v4 tooling upgrade (task_cc7d3fa38754) — no REL row status changes, counts unchanged. Recount re-confirmed 2026-08-24 after configurable-lease/drain-test task (task_46f6da82ae0c) — no REL row status changes, counts unchanged (suite now 45/45)_

## Parallelism & Anti-Overlap Policy

> This project runs REAL 24/7 multi-terminal orchestration. Parallelism is the
> default: unlimited tokens, multi-terminal app, massive project, close deadline.

- **Minimum fleet:** the orchestrator keeps AT LEAST 3 active worker terminals at
  all times. Fewer than 3 on resume or cycle end => launching more comes FIRST,
  chosen from the highest-priority TODO/VERIFY tasks in this file, focused on
  high-level goals and principles, not micro-edits.
- **One task = one worker:** claim a task by setting its status IN_PROGRESS and
  recording your terminal handle in the Session Ledger BEFORE starting. Claimed
  tasks are forbidden to everyone else.
- **One folder = one orchestrator:** never work another slot's folder.
- **One file = one writer:** two live workers never edit the same file; such tasks
  run sequentially.
- **Claim-before-work:** confirm your Task ID is still unclaimed before executing;
  if done or claimed, stop and report instead of duplicating.
- **Cross-project dependencies:** record them as notes in the OTHER project's task
  file; never edit another project directly.
- **Quality bar unchanged under deadline pressure:** no DONE without verified
  evidence; status change and Rollup update happen in the same edit.

## Deployment Decision & Research Summary (Aug 2026)

> Full research was reviewed, then consolidated here so the standalone research doc could be archived. Research date: Aug 2026.

### Decision

- **Stack: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (WebSocket Hibernation API) + Hono** — **$0/month at Fabrica scale**.
- **Crypto:** tweetnacl (NaCl box) + Web Crypto HMAC (see wire-compat below).
- **Auth:** Supabase validates the Fabrica access token; relay director validates the relay JWT on `/v1/assign`.
- **DB:** D1/SQLite per object (local SQLite for dev).
- **Client reconnects are mandatory** — Cloudflare deploys restart objects and drop sockets; the protocol's ping/pong + drain design already requires reconnect logic.
- All tasks below target Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects.

### Why Cloudflare wins for THIS relay

The relay's control connections sit idle most of the time (a phone–desktop pair only sends traffic during an active tunnel/transfer). Durable Objects + WebSocket Hibernation is purpose-built for that pattern:

1. **Idle sockets are free.** Hibernation lets the object sleep while clients stay connected — no duration charges accrue while idle. Every always-on VM platform bills 24/7 for sockets sitting in RAM; Cloudflare bills $0.
2. **Genuinely $0 at launch scale.** Free tier covers 100K requests/day and ~390K GB-s/month of duration — even a never-sleeping 128 MB object (~324K GB-s/month) fits. No card required.
3. **Best latency + zero cold start.** ~5 ms cold start; 330+ PoPs (~12 ms global P50). Phones/desktops connect to the nearest edge.
4. **No egress fees.** Tunnel traffic moves free.
5. **First-class tooling.** Hono + Durable Objects + Hibernation is a documented, well-trodden pattern.

### Platform Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | Cloudflare DO | Railway | Render | Vercel | Deno Deploy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free tier usable for relay? | **Yes ($0)** | No ($1 credit can't sustain 24/7) | No (15-min spin-down) | No (5-min sockets + non-commercial ToS) | Marginal (hard pauses) |
| Cheapest always-on | **$0** | ~$10–15/mo | $7/mo | ~$20/mo (Pro) | ~$0 (256 MB) risky |
| Persistent WS (no forced timeout) | ✅ (hibernation) | ✅ (verify 15-min claim) | ✅ paid / ❌ free | ❌ (300 s cap) | ✅ |
| Idle-connection cost | **$0 (hibernates)** | Full compute | Full compute (paid) | Cheap (active-CPU) but capped | Memory-time metered |
| Cold start | ~5 ms | none | 30–60 s (free) | ~35 ms | ~10 ms |
| Global latency (P50) | ~12 ms (330 PoPs) | 6 regions | regions (paid) | 30 regions | ~18 ms (35 PoPs) |
| Egress fees | **None** | $0.05/GB | $0.15/GB over 5 GB | within 100 GB | $0.50/GB over 20 GB |
| Ease of deploy | `wrangler deploy` | git deploy | git deploy | git deploy | git deploy |
| 10M req/mo cost | ~$5.50 | ~$15–30 | ~$25+ | ~$20+ | ~$200 |

### Per-Platform Notes (why each was accepted/rejected)

- **Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects — ⭐ chosen.** Free: 100K req/day (WS messages billed at 20:1; outgoing WS free), 13K GB-s/day (~390K/mo), 5 GB SQLite storage, no egress fees. Hibernation API = idle sockets cost nothing. Limits: 128 MB/object, 30 s CPU/request (configurable to 5 min), deploys restart all objects (drops sockets), no outbound socket in hibernation. Paid: $5/mo min, then $0.15/M requests, $12.50/M GB-s, $0.20/GB-mo storage.
- **Railway — rejected for the relay.** Free plan is $0/mo with **only $1/month credit** (1 vCPU/0.5 GB, 1 replica); when the credit runs out **all deployments auto-shutdown** until next month. A 24/7 relay costs ~$15/mo of usage — the $1 credit cannot sustain it. Hobby is $5/mo (+$5 credit). 10K concurrent-connection cap per domain (raiseable); a 15-min WS request limit is claimed by third parties but contradicted by Railway's own docs — unverified.
- **Render — rejected.** Free tier: 750 hrs/mo, 512 MB/0.1 CPU, **spins down after 15 min idle (drops all sockets), 30–60 s cold start**, single instance, free Postgres expires at day 90. Cheapest always-on is Starter **$7/mo**. WS supported on paid only.
- **Vercel — rejected.** WS is public beta (June 2026, Fluid Compute). Connection cap: **300 s on Hobby, 800 s on Pro, 1,800 s beta max** — forced reconnects every 5 min, no hibernation, no built-in fan-out (needs external Redis), Hobby is non-commercial per ToS. Great DX, wrong model for long-lived tunnels.
- **Deno Deploy — rejected.** Free: 1M req/mo, **20 GB egress**, 15 CPU-hr, 350 GB-h memory-time, 20 apps. **Hard pause** when any quota is exceeded (apps paused until next billing cycle — no overage). A 512 MB always-on app barely exceeds the memory quota. Overage on Pro: $2/M req, $0.50/GB egress → ~$200/mo at 10M req (5–10× Cloudflare).
- **Hono (framework) — adopted.** Runs the same code on Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Node, Netlify, Lambda. Native `upgradeWebSocket` + DO Hibernation pattern. Sub-12 KB, ~840K req/s routing. Portable if we ever move platforms.
- **Managed WebSocket/pub-sub services (Pusher-compatible: Vask, PushFlo, Relay Cloud, Apinator, LatteStream, PartyKit/Ably) — rejected.** The relay runs a **custom E2EE tunneling protocol** (challenge-response, per-connection data channels). Managed channel services don't support the protocol and would break E2EE guarantees.

### Cost Scenarios (always-on relay, active tunnels during transfers)

| Scenario | Cloudflare DO | Railway | Render | Vercel | Deno Deploy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Launch, 0–100 users | **$0** | ~$15/mo | $7/mo | $0 (but 5-min drops) | ~$0 (paused if quota hit) |
| 1K users, steady tunnels | ~$0–5 | ~$15–25 | $7–25 | $20 (Pro) | ~$20+ |
| 10K users, heavy | ~$5–30 | ~$30+ | $25+ | $20+ (Redis needed) | ~$200 |

### Implementation Path

- **Hono + Durable Objects** (`upgradeWebSocket` + Hibernation API) on Cloudflare Workers
- Director (HTTP) as a plain Worker; **Cell as a Durable Object class**
- Keep E2EE protocol unchanged (challenge-response, 64 KB payloads, JSON control channel)
- SQLite per-object (Durable Object storage) for leases/credentials; no Postgres, no central D1
- Client reconnect logic (already required by ping/pong + drain design) covers deploy-triggered disconnects

### Decisions Locked In (Aug 19 2026)

- **Stack confirmed: Hono + Durable Objects on Cloudflare. Auth: Supabase.**
- Supabase validates the Fabrica access token. The **relay director validates the relay JWT** on `/v1/assign` — default HS256 shared secret in env `FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET` (the auth backend signs the relay token; align the exact alg/secret with the Fabrica-web/auth backend owner before R29). `/v1/resolve` authenticates via `resumeToken` in the POST body (no Bearer).
- **DB confirmed: SQLite-backed Durable Objects per host** (no Postgres, no central D1) — see decisions #2.
- **Deploy-reconnect: accept client reconnects** (Cloudflare model) — see decisions #3.
- **Concurrency assumption: ~1,000 users / <100 simultaneous tunnels** — see decisions #4.
- **Control-channel caveat:** the cell's control socket must stay awake (see wire-compat #1). Cost still fits the free tier — one 128 MB object awake 24/7 ≈ 324K GB-s/month < 390K free. Data sockets hibernate.

### Wire Compatibility (client protocol) — REQUIRED

The server MUST be wire-compatible with the existing client code. These files in `Fabrica-app/src/main/runtime/relay/` define the contract (they ARE the spec — read before implementing):

- `relay-control-protocol.ts` — all message schemas (source of truth)
- `relay-control-url.ts` — URL shapes (no query params allowed)
- `relay-control-client.ts` — host control flow (64 KB max, text-only control)
- `relay-control-requests.ts` — reqId request/response over control (10 s client timeout)
- `relay-control-silence-watchdog.ts` — client kills socket after 75 s of message silence
- `relay-auth-coordinator.ts` + `relay-host-proof.ts` — challenge-response (NaCl box via **tweetnacl**, NOT @noble/ciphers; HMAC via `node:crypto` → swap to Web Crypto on Workers)
- `relay-http-client.ts` — the Director endpoints the client actually calls
- `relay-origin-pool.ts` + `relay-control-origin.ts` — drain/rebind/resume expectations
- `mobile/src/transport/mobile-relay-physical-client.ts`, `src/shared/mobile-relay-phone-protocol.ts`, `src/shared/mobile-relay-close-codes.ts` — phone side
- `mobile-relay-e2ee.integration.test.ts` — end-to-end behavior reference (no cloud relay server exists yet anywhere in the repo — this is greenfield)

Key constraints discovered (drive the architecture):

1. **Server sends app-level JSON `{type:'ping', t}` (epoch ms) every 15 s; client dies after 75 s of message silence and replies `{type:'pong', t}`.** Protocol-level WS pings do NOT satisfy the watchdog. A bare `{type:'ping'}` fails the client schema → close 4401. → The **control-channel DO must NOT hibernate** (no setTimeout/setInterval while hibernated; alarm-driven pings risk the client's 10 s reqId timeout and 15 s connect deadline). Control sockets stay awake; data sockets may hibernate.
2. **One cell origin must serve control + all data sockets for one host for the whole lease** (same-origin enforced). → Pin all sockets for a host to ONE DO instance (name by relayHostId/assignmentEpoch) and persist `generation`, `controlResumeSecret`, `leaseExpiresAt`, invites, pendingConns in `ctx.storage` so drain/lease-rotation rebind and phone `/v1/resolve` survive restarts.
3. **Data splicing:** relay forwards raw frames verbatim, preserving binary/text flag; first messages are JSON — host data socket sends `{type:'host-data-auth', v:1, connTicket, generation}` within the `attachDeadlineMs` window (≤60 s), phone sends `relay-auth`; `relay-hello` is sent only after both sockets attach. Preserve frame order.
4. **Size ceiling:** client data-socket cap = 1 MiB = Workers' max incoming WS message; E2EE text plaintext cap is 4 MiB (base64 overhead can exceed 1 MiB on the wire). Either reduce effective payload or add server-side chunking (a protocol extension — the client does none today).
5. **Crypto portability:** swap `node:crypto` HMAC/timingSafeEqual → Web Crypto `crypto.subtle`; `tweetnacl` (NaCl box) is pure-JS and bundles cleanly into Workers.
6. **Director endpoints (from client code):** `POST /v1/assign` (host — `Authorization: Bearer <relayToken>`, body `{v:1, relayHostId, reconnect?}` → `{v:1, cellUrl, assignmentEpoch, lease}`); `POST /v1/resolve` (phone resume — NO Bearer; auth via `resumeToken` in body `{v:1, relayHostId, resumeToken}` → `{v:1, cellUrl, assignmentEpoch, leaseExpiresAt}`); `WS /v1/connect/<relayHostId>` (phone invite recovery — the **Director** replies `relay-moved {v:1, cellUrl, assignmentEpoch}` with strictly-newer epoch, 5 s client timeout; the **Cell** replies `relay-hello`). The relay token is minted by the AUTH backend (`login.onFABRICA.dev`), NOT by the relay — the director only validates the relay JWT on `/v1/assign`.
7. **Close codes (client-defined, server MUST send exactly):** 4401 BAD_OUTER_CREDENTIAL, 4404 HOST_OFFLINE, 4408 PEER_DROPPED, 4409 WRONG_CELL, 4429 LIMIT_EXCEEDED, 4503 DRAINING.
8. **`drain` requires `recovery:'resolve-director'`:** `{type:'drain', graceMs (≤3,600,000), recovery:'resolve-director'}` — `recovery` is a required literal. Client synthesizes this exact shape on unexpected control close.
9. **`conn-open`:** `{type:'conn-open', connId, connTicket, kind:'invite'|'resume', relayDeviceId, attachDeadlineMs (≤60,000)}` — host must attach the data socket within the deadline. `host-hello-ack` requires `v:1`, `generation (>0)`, `controlResumeSecret`, `leaseExpiresAt`, `activeConnIds` (≤8), `pendingConns` (≤8).
10. **Other client-required control messages:** client sends `{type:'auth-refresh', relayJwt}` over control when the relay token refreshes; server replies to failed reqId RPCs with `{type:'control-error', reqId?, code}` (matched before kind-specific schemas); `relay-hello` can be `{type:'relay-hello', ok:false, code}` (4000–4999) on rejection.

### Decisions & Open Questions

1. ~~Swap to Hono + Durable Objects?~~ **DECIDED — yes.** (Aug 19 2026)
2. ~~Postgres, or per-object SQLite/D1?~~ **DECIDED — SQLite-backed Durable Objects (per host), no Postgres, no central D1.** (Aug 20 2026) Each host's cell object carries its own embedded SQLite DB — $0, self-contained, matches "one host = one DO". Escape hatch: D1 export or Hyperdrive→Postgres later if cross-host admin/analytics queries are needed. Applies to R24.
3. ~~OK with client reconnection on every deploy?~~ **DECIDED — yes, accept client reconnects (Cloudflare model).** (Aug 20 2026) The client protocol already has resume tokens, `reconnect:true` fast-lane, `drain` with `recovery:'resolve-director'`, and resume-confirm — it was designed for this. In-progress transfers re-establish in a few seconds. Applies to R25.
4. ~~Expected concurrent-tunnel ceiling?~~ **Assumed: ~1,000 users / <100 simultaneous tunnels at launch.** (Aug 20 2026) Cloudflare scales horizontally for free (one independent DO per host). Just implement per-host limits (8 active + 8 pending, client-enforced) + per-IP rate limit on `/v1/assign` (R28). No special architecture.
5. ~~What's needed from the Cloudflare account?~~ **CLARIFIED (Aug 20 2026):** Free tier is enough ($0, no card). Only three things needed, all at deploy time (R29): (1) **Account ID** — short string from the Cloudflare dashboard home page → `wrangler.toml`; (2) a **`wrangler login`** browser-auth on the PM's machine (orchestrator cannot do it) to authorize `wrangler deploy`; (3) a **Workers subdomain** chosen during account setup (any name — becomes the free deploy URL). Nothing needed for local dev — `wrangler dev` runs fully on-machine with no account.
6. ~~Relay JWT secret/alg alignment — what is it?~~ **CLARIFIED (Aug 20 2026):** The relay doesn't authenticate users directly. The auth backend (`login.onFABRICA.dev`) mints the relay token (a JWT, HS256 = signed with a **shared secret**). "Alignment" = the auth backend and the relay director must use **the same secret value + the same algorithm**, otherwise every connection is rejected. It's a coordination conversation with the auth-backend owner (Fabrica-web/auth), not a code task. **Not blocking Phase 1–3** — dev/test uses a locally-generated secret; only needed before the live deploy (R29).
7. ~~Relay domain?~~ **CLARIFIED (Aug 20 2026):** No relay domain needed — we don't own one and don't need to buy one. `wrangler deploy` gives a **free production HTTPS URL** automatically: `fabrica-relay.<workers-subdomain>.workers.dev`. Client addresses the relay via **configurable URLs** (`directorUrl`/`cellUrl` come from the auth backend's assignment — no hostname is hardcoded in client code), so the hostname can change later with zero client impact. A branded `relay.onfabrica.dev` is a Phase 4 nice-to-have only if we later own that domain. The landing-page domain (`fabrica-ai.vercel.app`) is untouched — the relay runs on Cloudflare, fully separate.
8. ~~What auth backend mints the relay JWT?~~ **DECIDED — use Supabase for auth (Aug 21 2026).** The desktop app authenticates via Supabase Auth; the relay validates the Supabase-issued JWT on `/v1/assign` by pointing `FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET` at the **Supabase JWT secret** (project settings). No custom auth backend (`login.onFABRICA.dev`) needed. The currently-deployed placeholder secret must be swapped to the Supabase JWT secret before real traffic. The client sends the Supabase access token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
 9. ~~Multi-host / multi-user scaling — single hub DO today?~~ **DECIDED — option (a), implemented (Aug 21 2026).** The single hub Durable Object now holds **many** desktop↔phone pairings keyed by `relayHostId` (multi-tenant, still $0, no client change). Per-host state (`hosts`, `controlWss`, `pendingChallenges`, `phoneConns`, `dataConns`, `connHost`/`connPhone`, per-host ping/lease timers) is isolated by `relayHostId`; the host id is resolved from WebSocket tags (phone path from URL, control after `host-hello`, data after `host-data-auth` via the `connHost` index). Option (b) per-host DOs was rejected (needs client URL change — violates wire-compat). Implemented as R31.

## Phase 4 — Production Readiness

> WHAT THIS GROUP DOES:
> - Deploy to Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects and make it production-ready (config, DB, drain, logging, rate limiting, multi-host).
>
> WHAT THIS GROUP DOES NOT DO:
> - No new protocol features beyond wire-compat requirements; no client-side changes.

| # | Task | Status | Output/Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------------|
| REL-R23 | Create wrangler config + build setup | ✅ DONE | wrangler.toml with DO binding, nodejs_compat, Hono/DO adapters |
| REL-R24 | Add database (SQLite-backed Durable Objects per host) | ✅ DONE | src/cell/store.ts — SQLite via ctx.storage.sql; host_state, invites, device_credentials, pending_conns tables; state persists across DO restarts |
| REL-R25 | Add graceful reconnect/drain handling | ✅ DONE | Rebind detection (generation + controlResumeSecret validation, 4409 on mismatch), drain message sent before lease expiry, lease timer adaptive (30s at production cadence), generation rotation on rebind. 2026-08-24: lease duration now configurable via `FABRICA_RELAY_LEASE_MS` env/wrangler var — drives BOTH `leaseExpiresAt` and drain `graceMs`; clamped to [5000, 3600000], default 3600000 (production behavior unchanged; wire format unchanged — graceMs ≤ 3,600,000 + recovery literal `resolve-director` preserved). Drain path now covered by a real integration test: `src/__tests__/lease-drain.integration.test.ts` boots an isolated Miniflare instance with FABRICA_RELAY_LEASE_MS=6000, completes host challenge-response, asserts strict client-style schema parse of `{type:'drain', graceMs:6000, recovery:'resolve-director'}` arriving BEFORE lease expiry, then clean control-socket close. Previous limitation "drain JSON path not triggerable in-process" is now COVERED. Note: server does not emit close 4503 DRAINING (client-synthesized) — unchanged. |
| REL-R26 | Add structured logging | ✅ DONE | src/shared/logger.ts — JSON structured logging via console.log |
| REL-R27 | Add health check endpoint | ✅ DONE | GET /health returns {ok:true} |
| REL-R28 | Add rate limiting | ✅ DONE | src/shared/rate-limit.ts — 10 req/min per IP on /v1/assign |
| REL-R29 | Deploy to Cloudflare | ✅ DONE | Live at https://fabrica-relay.fabrica-relay.workers.dev (Account 29426cba5c56f3a08df28fb89e48bb23, subdomain fabrica-relay). Single hub Durable Object; `FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET` set to the **Supabase legacy JWT secret** (verified: `/v1/assign` returns 200 with a Supabase-signed JWT). Deployed via API token. |
| REL-R30 | Update Fabrica-app task file | ✅ DONE | No client code changes required (client is source of truth for wire-compat); relay deploy noted in relay task file + roadmap |
| REL-R31 | Multi-host / multi-user scaling | ✅ DONE | Implemented (Aug 21 2026): the single hub Durable Object is now multi-tenant — all state keyed by `relayHostId` (per-host `hosts`/`controlWss`/`pendingChallenges`/`phoneConns`/`dataConns`/`connHost`/`connPhone` + per-host timers). Host resolved from WS tags (phone via URL, control after `host-hello`, data after `host-data-auth`). No client change, $0. Deployed; `/health` ok, `/v1/assign` still enforces Supabase JWT (401/200 verified). Deployed via API token. |

## Checkpoint (Current State)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Current Group** | Phase 4 — Production Readiness (complete); Phases 1–4 all implemented. **All 32 tasks DONE (100%)** |
| **Current Task** | Lease-drain-test (task_46f6da82ae0c) — work complete, awaiting orchestrator review |
| **Last Action** | 2026-08-24 configurable lease + real drain-path integration test: `FABRICA_RELAY_LEASE_MS` env/wrangler var (default "3600000", clamped [5000, 3600000], NaN→default) now drives `leaseExpiresAt` AND drain `graceMs` in src/cell/index.ts (previously hardcoded in ~6 places); drain warning window scales with lease (min(60s, lease/2)) and lease-timer poll is adaptive (30s at production cadence) so short leases still get a pre-expiry drain. Wire format unchanged. New test `src/__tests__/lease-drain.integration.test.ts` + shared helpers extracted to `src/__tests__/ws-helpers.ts`; harness now supports isolated per-binding Miniflare instances. Verified: `pnpm test` 8 files / 45 tests passed (44 prior + 1 new); `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0; `wrangler deploy --dry-run` lists FABRICA_RELAY_LEASE_MS binding. No deploy/commit performed |
| **Next Action** | Orchestrator: review diff, promote Lease-drain-test row/ledger; optional follow-up — set FABRICA_RELAY_LEASE_MS explicitly at deploy time if a non-default lease is ever wanted |
| **Blockers** | None |
| **Last Checkpoint** | 2026-08-24 |

## Autonomous Work System

- On heartbeat kick: read **Checkpoint** FIRST, then task tables, resume from **Next Action**. Never restart completed work.
- Statuses follow `.Fabrica-board/Fabrica-Schema.md` §1 exclusively (`TODO` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `VERIFY` / `DONE` / `BLOCKED` / `CANCELLED`). One status per row; extra detail goes in Notes.
- Worker finishing a task sets status → `VERIFY` with Notes evidence; orchestrator review promotes `VERIFY` → `DONE` and recounts Rollup in the same edit.
- Any status change updates the Rollup block in the same edit.
- Wire compatibility is non-negotiable: any change must match the client schemas in `Fabrica-app/src/main/runtime/relay/relay-control-protocol.ts`.

## Dependencies & Coordination Rules

1. **Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2** — tunneling requires working Director + Cell
2. **Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3** — device management requires working data channels
3. **Phase 3 must complete before Phase 4** — production deploy requires full feature set
4. **Shared types must be defined first** — all phases depend on protocol schemas
5. **Challenge-response is security-critical** — thorough testing required before deploy

## What Needs Verification

- [x] Director relay JWT validation rejects invalid/expired tokens on `/v1/assign` and `/v1/resolve`
- [x] Cell challenge-response prevents replay attacks (NaCl box + HMAC-SHA256, ephemeral keypairs)
- [x] Data tunneling preserves E2EE (server cannot decrypt — raw frame forwarding)
- [x] Wire-compatibility with client protocol verified (all message schemas match `.strict()` client schemas)
- [x] Lease expiry triggers graceful drain (REL-R25 — drain sent before lease expiry with `graceMs` = configured lease, rebind validated with generation + controlResumeSecret; 2026-08-24: drain path verified end-to-end by short-lease integration test)
- [x] Phone connection works with both invite and resume credentials (REL-R25 — invite flow in handlePhoneAuth, resume via rebind path)
- [x] Full integration tests with miniflare environment (2026-08-24: 17 integration tests under workerd — Director auth, challenge-response, keepalive, device RPCs, tunneling, close codes; 2026-08-24: +1 lease-drain integration test — drain JSON path now in-process covered; only the 4503 close remains client-synthesized)
- [x] Wire-compat bug fixes verified (2026-08-24: resolve cellUrl = public https origin; pendingConns exact `{connId, connTicket}` keys after storage reload; relay-moved on `/v1/connect` non-relay-auth first frame — 3 new integration tests, suite 44/44)

**Rules:**
- Only the main orchestrator creates sessions in this ledger
- Workers are released after review
- Worktrees are merged immediately after approval
- Never leave orphaned sessions

## Migration verification

- Source: `Fabrica-relay-tasks.md` (original, unmodified) → Target: `Fabrica-relay-tasks.v2.md` (this file). Migration date: 2026-08-23.
- Task count: old = 32 rows (R1–R11b: 12, R12–R16: 5, R17–R22: 6, R23–R31: 9) vs new = 32 rows (REL-R1–REL-R11b: 12, REL-R12–REL-R16: 5, REL-R17–REL-R22: 6, REL-R23–REL-R31: 9).
- Tasks present in old but missing in new: **none (zero)**.
- ID mapping: every local ID preserved with `REL-` prefix added (e.g. R31 → REL-R31, R11b → REL-R11b). No IDs reused or dropped.
- Status mapping (schema legacy rules): `DONE` → `DONE` (30 rows); `PARTIAL` → `IN_PROGRESS` (REL-R16, REL-R22). Legacy "Status Legend" section removed — superseded by the schema's §1 enum.
- Sections preserved verbatim: Deployment Decision & Research Summary (incl. Decision, platform matrix, per-platform notes, cost scenarios, implementation path, locked-in decisions, Wire Compatibility constraints 1–10, Decisions & Open Questions 1–9, Sources), all task Notes, Dependencies & Coordination Rules, What Needs Verification checklist.
- Structural changes per schema: Rollup block added (counts recounted from tables: total 32, DONE 30, IN_PROGRESS 2, completion 94%); Checkpoint (Current State) table added reflecting current reality; Autonomous Work System section added; Session Ledger rewritten to canonical columns (Handle | Type | Task ID | Orchestration IDs | Status | Created | Branch | Merged); group headers given DOES/DOES-NOT-DO bullets; Ledger status `active` normalized to `IN_PROGRESS`.
