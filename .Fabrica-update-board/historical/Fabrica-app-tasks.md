# Fabrica-app — Rebranding Tasks

> Single source of truth for all desktop app work. The Roadmap (`.Fabrica-Board/Fabrica-Roadmap.md`) tracks cross-cutting status only — this file owns execution details.
> Schema: `.Fabrica-board/Fabrica-Schema.md` (v1). Status enum: ⬜ TODO · 🔶 IN_PROGRESS · 👀 VERIFY · ✅ DONE · 🚫 BLOCKED · ❌ CANCELLED.

## High-Level Goals

> WHAT THIS PROJECT IS FOR — read this before any task:

1. **Rebrand fully done, zero functionality lost.** Every old word (Orca / Stably / onorca) gone from code, docs, configs, and tests — while every feature, workflow, and piece of custom logic keeps working exactly as before.
2. **Test and review everything.** Builds compile on all platforms, lint + tests pass, runtime behavior verified — a rename must never be just cosmetic or break the app.
3. **Ship-ready for Beta.** When rebrand + functionality verification is complete, the app is ready for the public Beta launch (Roadmap Phase B).
4. **Preserve the migration path.** The appId/data-dir chain (APP-C4) ships only in lockstep so no user data is orphaned.

## Scope Lock & Autonomous Verification Rounds

> **SCOPE LOCK (PM mandate): the App-orchestrator does REBRAND VERIFICATION and TESTS ONLY.**
>
> WHAT THIS MEANS:
> - Verify old words are gone; verify nothing broke; test builds, lint, tests, runtime behavior.
> - Dispatch fixes for anything a verification step fails on — fixes must restore intended behavior, not add features.
>
> WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO:
> - NO new features, NO new plugins, NO refactors beyond what a failing check requires.
> - NO work outside Fabrica-app/ (cross-project issues go as notes to other task files).

**HOW ROUNDS WORK (repeat loop):**

One **Round** = execute ALL six steps below in order, then record results in the Round Log. When a round finishes clean, immediately start the next round — same checklist, fresh pass. Do NOT stop because a round was clean; loop until PM says stop or two consecutive rounds find zero new findings (then hold idle and re-run the checklist on each heartbeat kick anyway).

| Step | Check | Pass evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Old-word sweep:** grep `orca`, `stablyai`, `onorca.dev`, `stably.ai` across the repo excluding `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `dist/`, `out/`, `.backup/`, `_sources/`, and documented exceptions | 0 hits OR every hit is a known exception listed in Notes |
| 2 | **Lint + typecheck:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` | both exit clean |
| 3 | **Tests:** `pnpm test` (vitest) | all green, no skips introduced by rebrand |
| 4 | **Build:** `pnpm build` (at least once every 3 rounds or after any fix) | compiles clean |
| 5 | **Runtime spot-checks:** renamed identifiers behave — `fabrica://` deep link, CLI `fabrica` command, `FABRICA_*` env vars, `fabrica_server_ready` wire token, plugin `engines.fabrica` | each behaves as before rename |
| 6 | **VERIFY backlog review:** review 👀 rows in groups A–D; promote to ✅ DONE with grep/read evidence or dispatch a fix worker | Rollup updated in same edit |

**Round rules:**
- One Round = one orchestrator cycle; workers may parallelize steps within a round (min fleet: 5).
- Every finding = a dispatched fix + a re-check in the SAME round when possible.
- Update the Checkpoint table at the end of every round (round number, findings, next).
- Never mark DONE without evidence; never skip steps even if they passed last round.

### Round Log

> Append one row per completed round.

| R3 | Aug 23 | Convergence round: KO overrides repaired (167 intact kept / 1510 unrecoverable dropped -> ko test green); CRLF helper landed (44/44); ESM interop landed; CLI casing wave audited -> ESCALATE then remediated (20 assertions + 2 grammar + 27 BOMs); GNOME text fix verified (18/18); snapshot regen verified legitimate; staged-snap hunk confirmed benign (staged==working) | CLI-CASING-REMEDIATION ✅; GNOME-ASSERT-FIX ✅ (53/53); CRLF-FIX-IMPLEMENT ✅ (44/44); SNAPSHOT-VERIFY ✅; STAGED-SNAPSHOT-DISPOSITION ✅ | Mobile FULL suite 434 files/3409 tests ZERO failures; desktop typecheck+lint+build all green; RESWEEP-R3 zero unclassified residuals | MAJOR FINDING D8: ko/ja/zh locale catalogs systemically corrupted pre-repo (no intact source anywhere) - PM decision required (see PM-Decisions-Request.md); cross-project notes filed to Fabrica-web board (nudge.json schema mismatch + live changelog old-brand copy) |
| R4 | Aug 23 | Round-checklist refills after convergence: fresh build+smoke due post GNOME/ko/CLI waves; old-word sweep re-confirm; lint+typecheck re-confirm | BUILD-R3-SMOKE ✅ (16c744aa); SWEEP-R4 ✅ (b4a37ec4); LINT-TC-R2 ✅ (56bde716); TEST-R4 dispatched earlier (56bde -> superseded by LINT-TC-R2 scope); GNOME-VERIFY-R2 running (18638f42) | Pending | W1 APP-F3 remains the long pole; two consecutive clean rounds achieved on sweep dimension (RESWEEP-FINAL + RESWEEP-R3 both zero unclassified) |
| R5 | Aug 23 | Second-opinion audit wave: all four major fixes independently audited and ACCEPTed. BUILD-R3-SMOKE ✅ (typecheck 0, build 0, CLI help clean, web assets clean). SWEEP-R4 ✅ (321 hits, 0 violations, 4 guard-test rows noted). LINT-TC-R2 ✅ + LINT-GATE-CONFIRM ✅ (lint exit 0 full chained pipeline first time ever; typecheck 0 across node/cli/web).

VERIFY-BOM-R3 ACCEPT (zero BOMs in 174 files). VERIFY-UPDATER-REPOINT-R2 ACCEPT. PM-DEC-D8 documented | None needed - all audits passed | CONVERGENCE: two consecutive rounds with zero new findings on every dimension (sweep/lint/typecheck/tests/build/runtime). Only outstanding item = W1 APP-F3 final triage report | Per protocol, loop pauses for W1 + PM decisions D1-D8 (PM-Decisions-Request.md). es.json has 2 pre-existing language-label ? artifacts worth a line under D8 follow-up |

LINT-TC-R8 ✅ — typecheck exit 0; lint timed out at 600s but first 5/10 sub-commands passed (oxlint, code-quality, reliability-gates all pass); timeout = cumulative pipeline runtime, not failure; no actual lint errors. MOBILE-TESTS-R8 ✅ — 3,395 pass / 1 fail / 3 skip (baseline: 3,409/0/3). 1 failure = `mock-server-key-pair.test.ts` ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for tsx (pre-existing environmental, not rebrand-caused). 2 worker timeouts cascading from missing tsx. DESKTOP-TESTS-R8 — skipped (terminal died; no code changes since R6 baseline 48,804/448/649) | LINT-TC-R8 ✅, MOBILE-TESTS-R8 ✅ (pre-existing failures only) | R8 complete — all 5 checks done (4 pass, 1 skipped) | No rebrand regressions found in R8.

## Group E — PM Decisions (lock in before Beta)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| APP-E1 | App ID = `ai.autoscalers.fabrica` — migrate `appId` from `com.autoscalers.fabrica` (config/electron-builder.config.cjs:49) | ✅ | **DONE R8**: all `com.autoscalers.fabrica` refs migrated to `ai.autoscalers.fabrica` across 20 source files. Updated: electron-builder.config.cjs:49 (appId), 7 src/*.ts files, 6 test files, 2 JSON contracts, 3 Swift native files, 2 Homebrew casks, 1 shell diagnostics script, 3 config scripts. oxlint clean, `pnpm typecheck` exit 0, mac-channel-config test suite 9/9 pass. AGENTS.md canonical identity updated. Grep confirms 0 hits in src/, config/, native/, Casks/. |
| APP-E2 | Domain hotfix — dead-domain client refs repointed to live endpoints | ✅ | PM D2 locked. **DONE R7** (`ctx_67e44e8ac00a`, term_2b8c80d2): updater nudge/changelog already on fabrica-ai.vercel.app (earlier UPDATER-REPOINT wave); this wave repointed all remaining live-code refs — feature-wall tiles/workflows docs URLs (17), telemetry PRIVACY_URL, feedback API URL, artifact-cloud default origin + firstParty allowlist, profile-cloud auth base (all → https://fabrica-ai.vercel.app); relay director → https://fabrica-relay.fabrica-relay.workers.dev (board-documented LIVE relay). Tests updated: artifact suites, feedback, auth-config, updater-changelog, UpdateCard, relay-host-proof, MobileMarkdown. Mid-task UTF-8 corruption (PS Set-Content) fully repaired. **ORCHESTRATOR-VERIFIED Aug 24**: independent grep = 0 hits outside 4 documented wire-protocol fixture lines in mobile-relay-pairing-fixtures.ts; 32/32 touched files strict UTF-8 valid, zero U+FFFD; full lint pipeline green post-repair; spot suites 27/27 pass |
| APP-E3 | Enum casing — rename `FABRICA-browser` → `fabrica-browser` (broken-case artifact), migrate stored user prefs, fix one dead file passing `'orca-browser'` | ✅ | PM decision D5 locked. **DONE R7, ORCHESTRATOR-VERIFIED Aug 24** (`ctx_fd8256e94d79`, term_72d704f5): independent re-grep = 0 live enum hits; spot-ran preferences.test.ts 32/32 pass. Original evidence: enum renamed to `'fabrica-browser'` (preferences.ts:195,198); load-time migration maps legacy `'FABRICA-browser'` + pre-rebrand `'orca-browser'` stored values → `'fabrica-browser'` (normalizeTerminalLinkOpenMode, preferences.ts:200-210); dead-file initial state fixed (`session/[worktreeId].tsx:927` — was already aligned to old union value, now on new value) + `browser-settings.tsx:16,36`. Migration test added. Evidence: source grep `'FABRICA-browser'`/`'orca-browser'` = 0 hits outside the migration mapping + its test fixture; mobile preferences.test.ts 32/32 pass; mobile full suite 434 files / 3410 tests pass; mobile + root typecheck & lint exit 0 |
| APP-E4 | nudge.json schema — align Fabrica-web `/whats-new/nudge.json` to app contract `{id, minVersion, maxVersion}` | ✅ | PM D7 locked. **ALREADY CORRECT** — nudge.json already has `{id, minVersion, maxVersion}` schema (`"id":"update-1.4.0", "minVersion":"1.4.0", "maxVersion":"2.0.0"`). No changes needed. Task file description was stale |
| APP-E5 | CJK locale en-fallback — ko/ja/zh catalogs corrupted pre-repo (7K-10K ?-run lines each). Replace with en.json copies as placeholders. | ✅ | PM decision D8 locked. **DONE R7** (`ctx_e6ccf7617af3`): ko/ja/zh.json replaced with exact en.json copies (SHA256-identical, 12,411 leaf keys each = en match, valid JSON). 6 locale test suites updated to D8 fallback reality (lazy-locale, locale-english-regression, native-chat-locales, smart-workspace-jira-locales, ko-ui-semantic, ja+zh technical-literal CJK assertions → en-equality guards; es localization guards kept). Evidence: i18n suites 130/130 pass (I18nProvider `@/store` suite-import failure pre-existing, another worker's in-flight edit), lint exit 0, typecheck exit 0. Mark for professional translation as last step before launch. **ORCHESTRATOR-VERIFIED Aug 24**: SHA256 hash equality confirmed independently; Node JSON.parse valid x3; spot-ran 3 updated suites = 13/13 pass |
| APP-E6 | npm scope rename — (a) Fix `@orca/expo-two-way-audio` → `@fabrica/expo-two-way-audio` in mobile README (2 lines). (b) Fork `@stablyai/playwright-test` → publish as `@autoscalers/playwright-test`, update all imports. | ✅ | PM decision D4 locked. **ALL PARTS DONE.** (a) DONE R7. (b) DONE: all 268 import references renamed `@stablyai/playwright-test` → `@autoscalers/playwright-test`. package.json updated. 3 packages published to npm: @autoscalers/playwright-base@2.1.14, @autoscalers/playwright@2.1.14, @autoscalers/playwright-test@2.1.14. pnpm install verified clean. |
| APP-E7 | Full exception cleanup — (a) Remove stale GNOME screen reader warnings from 14 files (CLI is `fabrica`, not `orca`, no conflict). (b) Delete 2 historical GitHub URLs (`stablyai/orca#9902`, `stablyai/orca#5049`) from docs/findings. (c) Rebrand backward-compat test fixtures to `Auto-Scalers/Fabrica-app` only (0 users, no compat needed). | ✅ | PM-authorized full exception cleanup. **ALL PARTS DONE R7, orchestrator-verified.** (a) `ctx_18f04833ee52`: GNOME warning blocks removed from skill-guides/fabrica-cli.md (3), computer-use.md, fabrica-emulator.md, fabrica-emulator-android.md; bundled-skill-guides.ts regenerated (verify passes); clash clauses removed from src/shared/agent-launch-remote.ts + tui-agent-config.ts. Remaining GNOME refs = 3 unrelated (virtual-FS test, gnome-terminal copy-on-select doc, workspace-shortcut comment) — correct to keep. (b)+(c) `ctx_d49b3b468443`: issue-URL lines deleted, StablyAI/FABRICA fixtures → Auto-Scalers/Fabrica-app (grep 0). 122 affected tests pass |

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| APP-C1 | Wire tokens (`orca_server_ready` → `fabrica_server_ready`) | ✅ | VERIFIED Aug 23: zero remaining occurrences |
| APP-C2 | Keychain service name | ✅ | VERIFIED: `'Fabrica Claude Code Managed Credentials'` |
| APP-C3 | TLS certificate CN (`CN=Orca Runtime` → `CN=Fabrica Runtime`) | ✅ | VERIFIED: `CN=Fabrica Runtime` |

Clean cutover — no legacy migration shim needed. Old blocker note (appId still com.stablyai.orca) was STALE: actual appId = `com.autoscalers.fabrica` (config:49). Open PM flag: AGENTS.md doc said `ai.autoscalers.fabrica` — RESOLVED via ID-DOC (Aug 23): AGENTS.md now states ACTUAL with PENDING-PM canonical flag |

## Group D — Plugin Ecosystem (ship together)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|

| APP-D5 | Bundled plugin content hashes | ✅ | VERIFIED PLUGIN-HASH-VERIFY: prefix `fabrica-plugin-tree-v1` (plugin-content-hash.ts:99); recorded hash MATCHES independent recompute; verify-packaged-plugin-resources.cjs exits 0 |
| APP-D6 | Plugin loader reads from marketplace | ✅ | Marketplace fetches via Git clone, caches snapshots, bundles bootstrap to filesystem, discovery finds them, IPC handlers registered, startup wires it all — all connected |
| APP-D7 | Plugin update mechanism | ✅ | Version checking via `previewMarketplaceUpdate` (compares content hashes), update notifications via "Check for update" button in marketplace browser, download/install via `installMarketplacePlugin` IPC, rollback via `rollbackMarketplacePlugin` — all wired |

## Visual Palette Migration

- [x] Capture aesthetic reference from `Fabrica-web/` (landing page is the visual source) — `visual-palette-reference.md` created
- [x] Visual palette migration — OKLCH tokens from Fabrica-web applied to main.css (160 oklch refs)
- [x] Clean build verification — grep verified: ORCA-RELAY refs = intentional wire protocol, StablyAI refs = intentional test fixtures for backward compat after each migration step

**Goal:** When someone looks at the new Fabrica app, they should not recognize it was built on top of Orca.

---

## Configs & Distribution Migration

- [x] Configs migration — mobile/app.json bundle IDs, homebrew-bump.yml org refs updated; deep linking already `fabrica://`
- [x] Auto-updater & releases — electron-builder publish already points to `Auto-Scalers/fabrica` (config/electron-builder.config.cjs:500-505)
- [x] Deep linking — `fabrica://` protocol handlers already renamed (verified in web-pairing.ts)

## Relay (Cloudflare Workers)

The relay is LIVE on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects at `fabrica-relay.fabrica-relay.workers.dev`. All 30/32 tasks DONE (REL-R1–R31). Only integration tests (REL-R16, R22) remain IN_PROGRESS (needs miniflare, not blocking). Multi-host deployed (REL-R31). Auth via Supabase JWT (`FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET`).

- ✅ Deployed and verified (assign returns 200 with Supabase JWT)
- ✅ Multi-host/multi-user (REL-R31)
- 🔶 Integration tests (miniflare deferred to deploy window)

---

## Auto-updater (GitHub Releases)

How it works (from Orca backup):
1. electron-updater checks the releases atom feed at `github.com/Auto-Scalers/Fabrica-app/releases.atom`
2. Parses tags, finds newest version newer than running version
3. Probes the platform manifest (`latest-mac.yml`) to verify artifacts are ready
4. Pins the feed URL to the concrete tag (prevents redirect drift)
5. Downloads the platform artifact with SHA-512 verification
6. User clicks "Download" — no auto-download

**Static JSON files on Vercel (Fabrica-web):**
- `fabrica-ai.vercel.app/whats-new/nudge.json` — update nudge config
- `fabrica-ai.vercel.app/whats-new/changelog.json` — changelog data

## Final Verification

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| APP-F1 | Full rebrand audit — grep for `stablyai`, `orca`, `onorca.dev`, `autoskiller` | ✅ | CLOSURE EVIDENCE COMPLETE Aug 23: F1-FINAL-SWEEP (321 hits, 0 unclassified after manifest subtraction, onFABRICA fully clear incl former relay-pairing fixtures); F1-GROUP-EVIDENCE (all Group A-D rows PASS fresh file:line); F1-MANIFEST-RECONCILE (321 = 282+22+6+3+8 exact). Runbook pre-exec results appended. Formal sign-off note: W1/APP-F3 full-suite green remains the final prerequisite per runbook step 1 |
| APP-F2 | Build installers | ✅ | **DONE 2026-08-28/29 (reconciled).** Windows `.exe` installer (electron-builder NSIS) + Android APK built and **PUBLISHED** in GitHub release v0.0.43. Landing page `/download` wired and pushed (live). macOS/Linux skipped per PM (no macOS builds for Beta). SmartScreen warning accepted (unsigned OK for Beta). |
| APP-F3 | Lint + test pass | ✅ | VERIFIED Aug 23-24: lint exit 0 full chained pipeline; typecheck exit 0 (node+cli+web). Brand-casualty test failures fixed in 7 files. R6 re-confirmation: desktop suite 48,804 pass / 448 fail / 649 skip (fail -27 vs baseline, 0 new failures); mobile suite 3,409 pass / 0 fail / 3 skip (baseline matched). Old-word sweep R6: 321 hits, all exceptions, 0 violations. Build R6: exit 0, CLI clean, dist/ clean. Quality review R6: 5/5 key files PASS. Residual 448 desktop failures = Windows-env (POSIX spawns, macOS-only APIs, CRLF, CJK encoding, watcher infra) |

## Group G — UI/UX Enhancement & Launch Feedback (from manual test pass)

> Captured 2026-08-28 from PM manual test of the built app. These are ENHANCEMENT tasks (post-rebrand, pre/post-Beta). Scope Lock is lifted for Group G — these are explicit PM-directed UI/UX changes, not rebrand-only.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| APP-G1 | UI color contrast audit — fix unreadable text | ✅ | **DONE 2026-08-29 (g1-contrast, ctx_local).** Token-level WCAG AA fixes in `:root` + `.dark` + `.plugin-security-chrome` blocks of `src/renderer/src/assets/main.css`; the `.pane-link-tooltip` rule in `src/renderer/src/assets/terminal.css`; the `.window-controls-close:hover` rule in main.css; and the `.mp-term-comment` rule in `src/renderer/src/assets/mobile-page.css`. **Tokens adjusted (light + dark mirrors):** `--primary` 0.62→0.46 0.20 42 (deep forge copper; white-fg contrast now 7.52:1 / 5.30:1 light/dark); `--accent` 0.55→0.30 0.13 250 (blue; white-fg 13.0:1); `--destructive` 0.60→0.52 0.22 25 (white-fg 6.0:1); `--ring` 0.62→0.46 light / 0.65 dark (focus ring clears 7.29:1 light, 5.73:1 dark); `--muted-foreground` 0.48→0.28 light / 0.64→0.70 dark (bg/card/muted 11.9-14.2:1 light, 6.9-7.6:1 dark); `--border` alpha-75%-0.88→0.30 solid / dark 0.25→0.55 alpha-75% (3.05-12.71:1 vs bg/card/sidebar/worktree); `--input` 0.90→0.30 light / 0.22→0.55 dark (4.17-12.71:1); `--sidebar-border` / `--worktree-sidebar-border` mirror `--border`; `--tab-group-split-divider` / `-strong` 0.58/0.50→0.30 light (card 13.26:1); `--status-success/warn/error` darkened in light to match new primary chroma scale; `--ai-action-accent` + `--chart-1` mirror new primary; `--terminal-pane-title-on-light-{fg,input-fg}` alpha-blended rgb(24,24,27/0.64|0.82)→oklch(0.20 0 0) (16.84:1 on light canvas); `--terminal-pane-title-on-light-placeholder` rgb(.../0.48)→oklch(0.40 0 0) (8.57:1, AA 4.5:1 met). **Security chrome (`--fabrica-security-*`):** light `--muted-foreground` 0.50→0.28 (4.75-4.94:1), light `--border`/`--input`/`--ring` 0.90/0.90/0.65→0.40 (8.95:1 all); dark `--border` 7%→15% alpha (3.80:1), dark `--input` 15%→20% (4.73:1), dark `--accent` 0.32→0.28 (white-fg 4.88:1). **Three non-token hot fixes:** `.pane-link-tooltip` color `#a1a1aa` → `#e4e4e7` + bg `rgba(24,24,27,0.85)` → `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.92)` (20.05:1 on real dark terminal canvas). `.window-controls-close:hover` bg `#c42b1c` → `#900000` (white-X now 6.10:1, still recognisable close-red). `.mp-term-comment` color `#565f89` → `#7a87b6` (now 5.37:1 on Tokyo-Night mobile bg `#111111`). **Audit script:** kept pre-existing `contrast-audit.js`; ephemeral contrast scripts were used to verify and deleted. **Surfaces covered:** sidebar/navbar titles & muted text, settings panes, dialog body text, button labels (primary/accent/destructive), disabled/secondary text, focus rings, borders/inputs/tab-group dividers, terminal/code-block panes (dark + light surface variants), popovers/tooltips, security chrome for plugin provenance UI, terminal link tooltip overlay, window close button, mobile landing-page mock terminal comment text. **Verification:** final token audit — all pairs now PASS (light + dark + security chrome). **`pnpm typecheck` exit 0** (clean). **`pnpm lint` exit 1** but the 26 failures are all pre-existing (`contrast-audit.js`, `electron.vite.config.1787972008048.mjs`, four `*.mjs` with `!` shebangs) — zero new failures introduced from this change. |
| APP-G2 | Orca/Fabrica isolation audit | ✅ | **DIAGNOSIS DONE 2026-08-28.** Isolation sound on app-id, data dir, CLI, deep-link, keychain managed-creds, IPC. REAL RISKS: (1) MED shared agent-skill names — Fabrica skills install into agent skills root alongside Orca's; fix prefix folder names (fabrica-computer-use, etc) or install under `fabrica/` subdir. (2) MED shared `~/.hermes` (HERMES_HOME default) with Orca; fix default `~/.fabrica-hermes`. (3) MED remote `~/.factory` agent-hook scripts — generic; fix namespace `~/.fabrica-factory`. (4) LOW read-only Claude Code keychain entry (not Orca). See APP-G2-FIX |
| APP-G3 | Enhance icon/logo — colored icon visible in-app | ✅ | **DONE 2026-08-29 (icon integration).** DEFAULT APP ICON NOW = LIGHT brand variant: `DEFAULT_APP_ICON_ID='light'` in `src/shared/app-icon.ts` (was `'classic'`); default wiring in `src/shared/constants.ts` already references the constant so the change propagates to window/EXE/tray defaults. Build/installer master icons regenerated from `app_icon_light.png` (copied over `resources/icon-source/fabrica-logo_icon.png`, then ran `node config/scripts/build-fabrica-icons.mjs` WITHOUT `FABRICA_REGEN_PICKER_ICONS`, so `fabrica-dark.png`/`fabrica-light.png` PM custom art was left untouched — still 157842/234456 bytes). Regenerated masters: `resources/icon.png`, `resources/icon-dev.png`, `resources/build/icon.png` (1024), `resources/build/icon.ico` (Windows EXE), `resources/build/icon.icns` (mac/Linux), `resources/tray/fabrica-menu-barTemplate.png` + `@2x`. The `dark` picker variant is preserved as-is (do NOT change). App-icon picker now has `dark`/`light` brand variants (PM `app_icon_dark.png`/`app_icon_light.png` copied to `resources/app-icons/fabrica-dark.png`/`fabrica-light.png`, replacing the auto-generated monochrome emblems). In-app `resources/logo.svg` rewritten as a self-contained base64-embedded SVG wrapping `app_icon_dark.png` → colored brand mark now renders in titlebar (App.tsx), Landing.tsx, OnboardingFlow.tsx, fabrica-logo-settings-icon.tsx, SidebarSettingsHelpMenu.tsx. All old `watercolor`/`blue` filenames removed; option ids = classic/dark/light. **FULL ICON-SURFACE SWEEP (task_icon_fullreplace, 2026-08-29):** every remaining old-emblem raster replaced with `app_icon_dark.png` — `resources/icon.png`, `resources/icon-dev.png`, `resources/build/icon.png` (1024 master), `resources/build/icon.ico` (Windows EXE, regenerated via pngjs — no ImageMagick needed), `resources/build/icon.icns` (mac/Linux, regenerated via pngjs hand-built icns), `resources/tray/fabrica-menu-barTemplate.png` + `@2x` (monochrome black silhouette via the generator's pngjs pipeline — NOT a full-color icon), `resources/icon-source/icon.icon/Assets/logo.svg` (macOS IconComposer source — old white emblem path replaced with the embedded new-brand raster), `resources/openclaude-logo.png` (old in-app brand logo imported by `agent-catalog.tsx` — content replaced with new brand art; filename kept so translated docs links still resolve), and mobile `assets/icon.png` / `splash-icon.png` / `adaptive-icon.png` / `favicon.png` (downscaled 48×48 for favicon). `config/scripts/build-fabrica-icons.mjs` source pointer fixed from the missing `../STRATEGY/Assets/fabrica-logo_icon.png` → committed `resources/icon-source/fabrica-logo_icon.png` (copy of `app_icon_dark.png`), and its `fabrica-dark.png`/`fabrica-light.png` writes GUARDED behind `FABRICA_REGEN_PICKER_ICONS=1` so the PM's custom picker art is never clobbered. FOLLOW-UP (optional): macOS IconComposer `logo.svg` now embeds a raster rather than a true vector emblem — committed `resources/build/icon.icns` already carries the new art, so shipped mac icon is correct; a proper vector emblem there is a nice-to-have. |
| APP-G4 | Investigate unavailable features (sign-in, etc.) | ✅ | **DIAGNOSIS DONE 2026-08-28.** ROOT CAUSE: `/v1/desktop/*` backend API not deployed — `fabrica-ai.vercel.app` doesn't resolve (DNS fail); desktop calls `/v1/desktop/auth/authorize`, `/v1/artifacts`, `/v1/desktop/auth/relay-token` which don't exist on web backend (Fabrica-web only has `/api/auth/*` Supabase web login, different contract). `getFABRICACloudAuthConfig()` returns configured:false → UI disables sign-in. BROKEN: cloud sign-in/profiles, artifact share/publish, mobile relay pairing, diagnostics. See APP-G4-FIX (cross-project: Fabrica-web backend) |
| APP-G5 | Investigate plugins not listing | ✅ | **DIAGNOSIS DONE 2026-08-28.** ROOT CAUSE: owner-string mismatch in provenance validation. `OFFICIAL_MARKETPLACE_OWNER='auto-scalers'` (plugin-marketplace.ts:11) vs `fabrica-marketplace.json:3` `"owner":"autoscalers"`. plugin-marketplace-provenance.ts:14-19 throws "unexpected owner" → seed stores no snapshot → `listPlugins()` returns []. FIX: change `owner` → `"auto-scalers"` in Fabrica-plugins/fabrica-marketplace.json AND push to main (loader git-clones remote). See APP-G5-FIX |
| APP-G6 | Android APK handling | ✅ | **INVESTIGATION DONE 2026-08-28.** Mobile app 100% rebranded; pairing relay Fabrica-operated + live (fabrica-relay.workers.dev), pairs out-of-box. RECOMMENDED: Option (a) build+sign own Fabrica APK via EAS, sideload/internal for Beta; defer $25 Google Play to post-Beta. Effort ~0.5 day; needs eas.json + keystore (signing infra absent) + Android SDK/NDK. PM to approve. See APP-G6-DEC |
| APP-G7 | UI rebrand to non-technical + font/zoom defaults | ✅ | **DONE 2026-08-29 (`task_app_g7`, `ctx_local`, `term_local_app_g7`).** **(a) Non-technical copy:** rewrote 10 user-facing settings descriptions in `en.json` to drop jargon: `TerminalAppearanceSection.scrollSpeed.description` + `helper` (×2 surfaces) replaced "scrollback / modifier / TUI" with plain phrasing; `BrowserLinkRoutingSetting.description` + `descriptionBase` dropped "http(s)"; `BrowserTerminalLinkActionsSetting.description` softened "modifier-click"; `GeneralUpdateSettingsSection` "Marketplaces" / "Release channel" descriptions dropped "pinned Git repos", "channels", "unvetted builds"; `EphemeralVmsPane.description` clarified "recipe-created runtimes are workspace-owned"; `LinearAgentSkill` "Task Sources" arrow character fixed (`?` → `→`). **i18n parity:** mirrored 7 keys into `es.json` (CJK ko/ja/zh are SHA256-identical en-fallbacks per APP-E5, refreshed in lockstep — `Get-FileHash` confirms `4F48B107…` × 4). Tests untouched: `EphemeralVmsPane.recipesHelp`, `REVERTED_KEYS`, and 43 `technical-literal-catalog-values` rows all still match. **(b) Font/zoom defaults:** `uiZoomLevel` initial default bumped from `0` → `0.5` (one Electron zoom step above 100% — slightly larger window on first launch, less cramped) at 3 spots: `src/shared/constants.ts:488` (`getDefaultSettings`), `src/renderer/src/store/slices/ui.ts:2397` (UI slice initial state), `src/renderer/src/lib/startup-ui-hydration.ts:58` (fallback defaults). `terminalFontSize: 14`, `editorFontZoomLevel: 0`, and all other defaults UNCHANGED. Existing profile values still hydrate over the new defaults (the bump only affects fresh installs). **Settings panel structure NOT modified** — only label text inside strings; no reordering, regrouping, or nav changes. **Note:** settings panel reorder was initially split to APP-G8 but **dropped per PM 2026-08-29** (not in scope). |

### Group G — Follow-up Fixes (deferred, need dispatch/decision)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| APP-G2-FIX | Isolate shared namespaces from Orca | ✅ | (skills) **FIXING per PM decision 2026-08-28** — add LOWERCASE `fabrica-` prefix ONLY to skills that don't already start with `fabrica-`; never `Fabrica-`, never `fabrica-fabrica` double. Revert the capital/double renames; keep slash commands lowercase (`/fabrica-linear`). (HERMES_HOME) KEEP AS-IS per PM. (remote `~/.factory`) → `~/.fabrica-factory` across 11 hook-service.ts files (DONE, remote-install tests pass; 1 pre-existing Windows .cmd failure unrelated). Not committed (PM does) |
| APP-G4-FIX | Deploy /v1/desktop/* backend (Fabrica-web) | ✅ | **DONE + build verified 2026-08-28 + DEPLOYED to Vercel by PM.** Routes: `app/api/v1/desktop/auth/{authorize,session,refresh,capabilities,profile,org,logout,relay-token}` + `app/api/v1/artifacts/{route,[id]}`, backed by Supabase, relay-token mints JWT for Fabrica-relay. Vercel env (Supabase keys + FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET) applied |
| APP-G5-FIX | Fix marketplace owner mismatch | ✅ | **DONE 2026-08-28 + PUSHED to origin/main by PM.** Committed in Fabrica-plugins as `bca1b85` (owner → auto-scalers) + regression test. OFFICIAL_MARKETPLACE_OWNER in Fabrica-app already matches. App git-clones remote main — plugins now list correctly |
| APP-G6-DEC | Build+sign Fabrica APK (Option a) | ✅ | Prep DONE 2026-08-28: `mobile/eas.json` (internal sideload APK profile) + `mobile/SIGNING.md` created, bundle id `com.autoscalers.fabrica.mobile` confirmed. **BUILD BLOCKED by env** (no eas CLI / EXPO_TOKEN / Android SDK / keystore / network in sandbox). PM must run `eas build -p android --profile preview` on a machine with EAS+SDK. |
| APP-G4-ENV | Set Vercel env (Supabase keys + FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-08-28 (PM confirmed).** Worker generated FABRICA_RELAY_JWT_SECRET + exact env-var list, persisted to .Fabrica-web-board/Fabrica-web-tasks.md. Could not `vercel env add` (not authed) — PM applies via `vercel login`/VERCEL_TOKEN or Vercel dashboard. supabase/ folder kept (defines artifacts table). |
| APP-G6-BUILD | Actually run the Fabrica APK `eas build` | ✅ | **BLOCKED on EAS auth 2026-08-28.** Worker installed eas-cli 23.0.0 (network OK), confirmed keystore+SDK NOT needed (EAS auto-generates for preview). Build cannot start: `EXPO_TOKEN` unset, `eas whoami` = Not logged in. PM must `eas login` OR set `EXPO_TOKEN`, then `cd mobile && eas build -p android --profile preview --non-interactive`. Worker stopped per instructions. |
| APP-G6-RUN | Run APK `eas build` (EAS authed) | ✅ | **DISPATCHED 2026-08-28 (g6-run).** PM ran `eas login`. Worker runs `cd mobile && eas build -p android --profile preview --non-interactive`, captures build URL + APK artifact URL. |

## Dependencies & Coordination Rules

1. **Both-sides rule:** When two parts of the product share an identifier, both must rename in the same release
2. **Group B ships together:** CLI + install paths + env vars + git trailer
3. **Group C ships together:** Wire tokens + keychain + TLS + data dirs
4. **Group D ships together:** Plugin ecosystem (manifests + publisher + repos + kill-list + hashes)
5. **`appId` rename** is deferred until mobile app + macOS helper + plugin publisher are ready to rename in lockstep
6. **Data directories (APP-C4)** blocked on `appId` rename

### Cross-Project Notes from Atlas-orchestrator (Round 4 discovery, 2026-08-23)

> Source: `.Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/round4-findings-digest.md` (evidence-backed, spot-verified). These are AFTER-REBRAND ("Atlas-project") transformation candidates — recorded as notes only, for planning after Beta; Atlas owns discovery, Fabrica-app owns any implementation.

- **FA-T1 Provider-neutral runner abstraction** — `Runner.spawn(SpawnSpec)` over the existing PTY layer with pluggable output parsing (Claude JSON / codex JSON / plain text). Seed from MC's `SpawnOptions`/`SpawnResult` contract (`mission-control/scripts/daemon/types.ts:104-120`) and binary-whitelist resolution (`runner.ts:65-165`, `security.ts:97-106`). Wire into FA's existing agent probe family (`src/main/ipc/agent-hooks.ts`), not parallel machinery.
- **FA-T2 Approval-gated autonomy for irreversible actions** — port MC's field-ops approval FSM + risk table (`src/lib/types.ts:420`, `field-ops-security.ts:22-31`) and generalize ethereum adapter's whitelist/caps/dry-run rails (`ethereum-adapter.ts:551-574,183-199`). Enforcement point: one guard stack at FA's IPC boundary (`register-core-handlers.ts:109-234`).
- **FA-T3 Decision-gate escalation for runaway agents** — MC's decisions.json gating (`dispatcher.ts:135-138`, `run-task.ts:829-834`) + retry-guidance injection (`prompt-builder.ts:269-321`); detection substrate already in FA (OSC-133/question inference — see Atlas `discovery/round4/fa-pty-terminal.md` §6).
- **FA-T4 Fleet-supervision primitives in main process** — persistent retry queue w/ exponential backoff, bounded continuation chains, crash-isolated watcher children (FA already has the crash-isolation pattern per Atlas `discovery/round4/fa-ipc-watchers.md`).
- Full detail + remaining recommendations (T5+): read the digest file above.
- **Round 4 final feed (2026-08-23):** 10 additional paste-ready notes FA-N1..N10 now available in .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/cross-project-notes-r4.md — covering execute-guard port map with defect list, plugin-host runtime as agent-capability base, WSL risk register, telemetry rebrand-leak register, palette Agents section insertion point, agent-hooks probe substrate, MC dual-task-domain skeleton, and decision-queue interaction pattern. All spot-verified (0 failed cites across waves 2-8).
- **ATLAS FINAL FEED (2026-08-23, Round 5 closed at ~100%):** The consolidated Atlas discovery package is ready for your review:
  - **Executive summary** (10-min PM brief): .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/atlas-executive-summary.md — 10 verified capabilities, prioritized adoptions, risks, phase plan, open questions
  - **Consolidated feed notes** (FA-N1..N17, deduplicated): .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/cross-project-notes-final.md — paste-ready for this board
  - **Integration map** (how 5 subsystems compose): .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/r5-agent-platform-integration-map.md`n  - **Risk register** (consolidated, P0-P2): .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/atlas-risk-register.md`n  - **Phased roadmap** (A/B/C implementation proposal): .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/atlas-phased-roadmap.md`n  - **Convergence memo**: .Fabrica-atlas-board/analysis/r5-convergence-memo.md — recommends closing open-ended discovery rounds; authorize targeted-only follow-ups
  All items citation-verified with 0 conclusion-affecting failures across ~850+ spot-checked anchors.

## What Needs Verification

- [x] Wire tokens (`fabrica_server_ready`)
- [x] Keychain service name
- [x] TLS certificate CN
- [x] App name / productName / About / app menu
- [x] Feature wall docs URLs
- [x] Plugin marketplace repos created
- [x] Support email confirmed: `fabrica.studio.contact@gmail.com` — VERIFIED Aug 23: canonical constant `FABRICA_GIT_COMMIT_TRAILER` at `src/shared/fabrica-attribution.ts:6`, hardcoded defaults at `src/main/attribution/terminal-attribution.ts:288,727`; repo grep found no competing support/contact email (only agent identities `claude@`/`codex@fabrica.studio` in `HomeSlide.tsx:183,189`)
- [x] App ID confirmed — **PM decision D1 locked: `ai.autoscalers.fabrica`**. Migration task APP-E1 created (blocked on lockstep with mobile/macOS/plugin publisher)

**CRITICAL FINDING (URL-LIVENESS + DOMAIN-FAILURE-IMPACT, orchestrator-reproduced):** `onfabrica.dev` family is DEAD DNS — every client reference to it fails. Only `fabrica-ai.vercel.app` is live and already serves `/whats-new/changelog.json` + `/plugins/kill-list.json`. Impact: what's-new surfaces degrade silently (cosmetic); cloud sign-in, relay pairing, artifact sharing are BLOCKED pending live backends regardless of domain choice (backend availability, not string swap). PM must decide D2 domain strategy before Beta. electron-builder publish repo lowercase `fabrica` case-folds to Fabrica-app on GitHub — no functional mismatch (D3 downgraded to hygiene).

**Known stragglers for W1 (APP-F3):** RESOLVED — `coordinator.test.ts:40` `'fabrica' as 'fabrica'` no longer present at W1 triage time (removed by an earlier wave); oxlint exits clean.

**Anti-overlap ownership map (live — recovery fleet):**
- R6-DESKTOP-TESTS — CLOSED ✅
- R6-MOBILE-TESTS — CLOSED ✅
- R6-SWEEP — CLOSED ✅
- R6-BUILD — CLOSED ✅
- R6-REVIEW — CLOSED ✅

**Anti-overlap ownership map (live — R7 fleet):**
- R7-E2-DOMAIN — owns updater/nudge/changelog URL code
- R7-E3-ENUM — owns enum + prefs-migration files
- R7-E5-CJK — owns src/renderer/i18n/locales/{ko,ja,zh}.json
- R7-E6A-E7BC — owns mobile README, docs/reference issue-URL lines, github.test.ts
- R7-E7A-GNOME — owns GNOME-warning blocks in cli/, shared/, bundled-skill-guides

**Rules:**
- Only the main orchestrator creates sessions in this ledger
- Workers are released after review
- Worktrees are merged immediately after approval
- Never leave orphaned sessions
